In other words, show that if \\(X_0=0\\) and \\(X_1=\\Delta_0 S_1 + (1+r)(X_0-\\Delta_0 S_0)\\) then we cannot have \\(X_1\\) strictly positive with positive probability unless \\(X_1\\) is strictly negative with positive probability as well, and this is the case regardless of the choice of the number \\(\\Delta_0\\).\nAnswer:\nThe condition (1.1.2) is given by:\nIn the one-period binomial model, to rule out arbitrage we must assume \\(0 < d < 1+r < u\\).\nArbitrage is a trading strategy that involves no initial investment and has a positive probability of making a profit.\nLetâ€™s assume that \\(X_0=0\\) and \\(X_1=\\Delta_0 S_1 + (1+r)(X_0-\\Delta_0 S_0)\\) for two possible states of the world \\(H\\) and \\(T\\). We have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{cases}\nX_1(H) &= \\Delta_0 S_1(H) + (1+r)(X_0-\\Delta_0 S_0(H)) \\\\\nX_1(T) &= \\Delta_0 S_1(T) + (1+r)(X_0-\\Delta_0 S_0(T))\n\\end{cases}\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\n\\begin{cases}\nX_1(H) &= \\Delta_0 u S_0 + (1+r)(X_0-\\Delta_0 S_0) \\\\\nX_1(T) &= \\Delta_0 d S_0 + (1+r)(X_0-\\Delta_0 S_0)\n\\end{cases}\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\n\\begin{cases}\n\\Delta_{0} = \\frac{X_1(H) - (1+r)X_0}{uS_0 - (1+r)S_0} \\\\\nX_1(T) = \\frac{X_1(H) - (1+r)X_0}{uS_0 - (1+r)S_0} d S_0 + (1+r)(X_0-\\frac{X_1(H) - (1+r)X_0}{uS_0 - (1+r)S_0} S_0)\n\\end{cases}\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\nX_1(T) = \\frac{X_1(H) - (1+r)X_0}{u - (1+r)} d + (1+r)(X_0-\\frac{X_1(H) - (1+r)X_0}{u - (1+r)})\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\nX_1(T)(u-1-r) = dX_1(H) - (1+r)dX_0 - X_1(H) + (1+r)(u-1-r)X_0 - (1+r)X_1(H) + (1+r)^2 X_0\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\nX_1(T)(u-1-r) = (d - 1 - r)X_1(H) + (1+r)(-d+u-1-r+1+r)X_0\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\nX_1(T)(u-1-r) = (d - 1 - r)X_1(H) + (1+r)(u-d)X_0\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\n0 = X_0 = \\frac{1}{1+r}[\\frac{u-1-r}{u-d}X_1(T)+\\frac{1+r-d}{u-d}X_1(H)]\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\n0 = X_0 = (u-1-r)X_1(T)+(1+r-d)X_1(H)]\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFrom condition 1.1.2, we have \\(0 < d < 1+r < u\\). This implies that \\(u-1-r > 0\\) and \\(1+r-d > 0\\). Therefore, if \\(X_1(T) > 0\\) then \\(X_1(H) < 0\\) and vice versa. This shows that if \\(X_1\\) is strictly positive with positive probability, then \\(X_1\\) is strictly negative with positive probability as well.\nHence the condition (1.1.2) precludes arbitrage.\nExercise 1.2\n\n\n\n",
