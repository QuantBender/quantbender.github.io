### What I do

I am a scientist always hungry to learn new things
about
Technology,
Mathematics, Machine Learning, and
Project Management. I am very
curious and always ready to work on
challenging tasks. I really prefer
deliberate practice and I am use to
take part to competitions on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and
[Zindi](https://zindi.africa/).

Here, I write articles on everything I learn. It's a kind of log journal for me. 
I cover topics like data visualization, modelling, engineering and also share 
techniques I use in programming contests.

### Personal

In the twenties, beninese and passionate of activities such as playing basket ball,
jogging, reading and blogging, I am aiming to become a renaissance man, someone
who is passionate about every arts and sciences, someone who keeps to have doubts
about the answers to his questions.


### Academic Background

<span itemprop="description">
Even though my interest is in data science generally, I started off majoring in [Economic Statistics](http://eneam.uac.bj/) as an undergraduate, and eventually obtained a certification in [Data Science](https://dit.sn/). During undergraduate school, I became interested in data science for practical reasons, eventually choosing it as a concentration. That turned out to be a good fit for me, and I've been exploring and analyzing data ever since.

### Present

<span itemprop="description">
Currently I am an <span itemprop="jobTitle">Independent Data Scientist</span>, and I provide analytical insights and programming expertise to enable customers from a different range of industries realize their objectives.
</span>

<span itemprop="description">
Previously, I was a Data Analyst Intern for [APG](https://www.afripayway.com/) in Dakar, Senegal. Before that, I was a Statistician intern <span itemprop="affiliation alumniOf">[INSAE](https://insae.bj/) at the National Institute of Economic and Statistical Analysis in Benin.  In both settings I provided analytical, visualization, programming, conceptual, and other support to company. 
</span>

<br>

I am passionate about doing quality work that answers the questions at hand. What drew me to the world of data science and keeps my interest is that it frees me to engage in whatever science I like, and provides a great many tools with which to discover more about the things we humans are most interested in. CV can be found [here](medias/CV_AI_ENGLISH.pdf). Feel free to reach me if you got any questions.
